# LowPrecisionApproxGP
Github repository for Low Precision Approximate Gaussian Process Inference - a group project for CDS's Bayesian Machine Learning class - created by Giulio Duregon, Jonah Poczobutt, and Paul Kottering.

## TODO: 
Setup:
- Create scripts to download in datasets
- Figure out which overlays (or how to make them) are necessary for running a container
- Get script to download overlay and launch singularity container
- Update `dataIntoRam.sh` script to point to saved file location on cluster

Modeling: 
- Implement baseline model with full precision
- Figure out how to change precision as necessary for experiments
